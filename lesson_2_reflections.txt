What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? it creates the first 
commit for that directory. it has to have somewhere to start. How is the staging area different
 from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? the staging area
  is a middle man for while you add the different file you want to commit into your repository. its
  awesome because sometime you might not need or want to commit all files. you can also check the status
   to see what files are in the staging area to make sure you ave everything you wanted ready for the
    commit.
