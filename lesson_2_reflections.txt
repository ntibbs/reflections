What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? it creates the first 
commit for that directory. it has to have somewhere to start. How is the staging area different
 from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? the staging area
  is a middle man for while you add the different file you want to commit into your repository. its
  awesome because sometime you might not need or want to commit all files. you can also check the status
   to see what files are in the staging area to make sure you ave everything you wanted ready for the
    commit.How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change? you can add one single file to the staging area or multiple files depending on what all is effected by the change. then you can look at the diff to make use you are only subitting files for that one change to the new commit.
